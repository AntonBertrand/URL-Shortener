# URL-Shortener
URL Shortener web app using API. Users can enter a URL and it will provide them with a shortened version which they can copy to their clipboard.

This project was created as part of a front-end coding challenge.

The requirements were:
- Get it looking as close to the design as possible
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
